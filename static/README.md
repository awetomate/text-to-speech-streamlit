The static folder contains any static configuration files, images, CSS files, etc. 

#### css
The custom CSS file in this sample app does not do that much, apart from removing the streamlit branding. It does contains some commented out sections that can still serve as an example of how different style aspects of the Streamlit app could be customized.

#### img
The image folder contains the logo.png file that is used as a logo at the top of this example Streamlit app. The same file is used for as the page icon, too.
Replace the image with your own and/or change the configuration in the main app.py file.
